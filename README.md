# AutoVclip Addon for the Meteor Client.

<h2>How to use:</h2>

* Use the command ".avclip up/down" or ".avc up/down" to automatically vclip up or down.

<i>(You can also bind the ".avclip up" and ".avclip down" commands, by creating a macro within the Meteor Client).</i>

<h2>What makes AutoVclip different from AutoClipAddon?</h2>

- **AutoVclip** changes the way the player is being teleported, to a more efficient and non-clunky one. Instead of teleporting to the position of the closest block, it now teleports the player to the height of the block, thus reducing clunkiness.

- **AutoVclip** actually vclips the player up, if it detects a block within the 10 blocks upwards limit. You do not need to, directly, stick your head one block below the block you want to clip through.

- **AutoVclip** works with boats and other rideable entities too!
